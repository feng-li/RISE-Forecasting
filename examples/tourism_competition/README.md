# Tourism Competition Example

This directory will host the paper reproduction workflow on top of the reusable
`riseforecast` package.

The migration should keep tourism-specific files here:

- competition data loading and column mapping
- Baidu search keyword configuration
- flight data preparation
- destination hierarchy
- paper-specific recovery score table
- reproduction checks against legacy Excel outputs

The terminal forecast stage can already be run against the legacy baseline
artifact:

```bash
python examples/tourism_competition/terminal_forecast.py
```
